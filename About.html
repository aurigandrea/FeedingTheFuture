  <h2>About this project</h2>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Feeding the Future is a small educational card game that compares food items by sustainability and nutrition metrics. </p>
<br>
    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>The material was developed by members of the TRAnsforming the DEbate about Livestock Systems Transformation (TRADE) project, the Division of Global Agriculture and Food Systems, and the Institute for Design Informatics at the University of Edinburgh, and funded by UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) under grants BB/W018152/1 and ES/P000681/1.
 The original physical card game was developed by Kirsty Blair with contributions and support from Prof Peter Alexander, Dr Jay Burns, Prof Dominic Moran, and Prof Jonathan Hillier.
Thanks also to Dr Joe Kennedy and colleagues (see preprint below) for providing data and allowing its use in this material. Special thanks to Dr Andrea Kocsis for creating the digital version of the game.</p>

<br>   
<h3>How to play</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The app shuffles and deals cards between the human and computer player.</li>
      <li>Players select a metric (e.g. greenhouse gas, water use, protein) and the higher or lower value wins depending on the metric.</li>
      <li>The game keeps score and proceeds round by round until all cards are played.</li>
    </ul>
<br>
    <h3>How it works</h3>
    <p>It's built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript and uses a simple data file to populate the cards.</p>
